That was also when I first knew about modular programming concepts like libraries and dependencies.\r\n\r\n- When starting my master\u2019s study in the same year, I had a chance to develop a web scraping Android application in a 6-month project. Before doing this, I had thought of Mobile App Development as a fun hobby of tech geeks. Only until I actually tried it, did I realized all the apps I had been using everyday were constant effort of professional teams.\r\n\r\n- In 2017, as a requirement of the course Advanced Multimedia Communication, I had to do a small team project related to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). I decided to put aside my professor's boring suggestions and do something fun with SIP. I cloned the Linphone Mobile application and started tinkering with it. I added a fun feature with which 2 users on a call session can watch a synchronized video together. This project was applauded by my professor and the whole class since it was (I guess) the only understandable one.\r\n\r\n- My journey with web development also began in 2017 when I received a 2-year internship at Autodesk where I gained valuable hands-on experiences, which made me keen on pursuing this career path.\r\n\r\n- In 2018, I lead a team of 4 students on another university project. We developed a prototyped \"social network\" for gamers in which the user can post, comment and rate video games. I developed the server-side app of it using Express, NodeJS. One colleague developed the client-side app using AngularJS while the others designed an SQL database and deployed the Docker image of the server-side app on GCP. Our professor was quite impressed by what we achieved in just 1 month of work. All of us then received very good marks.\r\n\r\n- In 2019, I did a university research project on the Web Browser and JavaScript Engine, with which I gained a lot of insight into what happen behind the scene whenever a web app is running.\r\n\r\n- In 2020, I graduated from Autodesk and started my personal development projects. I took a course about Machine Learning since I was curious why this topic is so popular in the recent years. I also spent time browsing and contributing to open source projects, and learnt advanced concepts of JavaScript.\r\n\r\n- Also in 2020, I started my master's thesis (finally) after 4 years of study. I was inspired by the TensorFlow Playground and started looking for similar ML algorithm visualization apps on the the Internet but could not find anything as interactive and complex as this Playground. I decided to fork Playground and build my own visualization app for Random Forest and Decision Tree. My product will be deployed on my university's website and may be used by professors who want to teach these algorithms.\r\n\r\n# I like\r\n\r\n- [Chess](https://www.chess.com/stats/live/rapid/mcsn)\r\n- [Books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40542298-long-nguyen)\r\n- Podcasts ([JavaScript Jabber](https://devchat.tv/podcasts/js-jabber/), [Soft Skills Engineering](https://softskills.audio/), [TED Talks Daily](https://open.spotify.com/show/1VXcH8QHkjRcTCEd88U3ti?si=30AEScAKTbiUn2HJ8ykJgQ), [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/), [Shoptalk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com/))\r\n- [Photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/153340976@N07/)\r\n\r\n# Fun facts\r\n\r\n- I can remember many flags, challenge me.\r\n- I have a huge love for maps.\r\n- I always solve problems with a minimalist approach. I would first solve them with least tools to see the limitations before using more advanced ones.\r\n- Even though I want to build beautiful website, I prefer realizing someone else's wireframes rather than coming up with my desing ideas. I favor \"getting things done\" more than polishing them. You can find a minimalist mindset in everything of mine (app UI, resume, this website).\r\n\r\n# I dream of\r\n\r\n- architecting a software that has a huge positive impact on people's everyday life.\r\n- having a business of my own.\r\n",l=d.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,c=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(a.jsx)(s.b,Object(o.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(a.jsx)(h.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Long Nguyen",children:Object(a.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(a.jsx)("header",{children:Object(a.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(a.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(a.jsx)(s.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(a.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",l," words)"]})]})}),Object(a.jsx)(i.a,{source:d,renderers:{Link:c},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
